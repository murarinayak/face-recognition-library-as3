Face recognition (do not to be confused with face detection) library for Flex applications. Library uses Eigenface (PCA) method for face recognition. You can use is it for recognition of any kind of objects not only faces.

Now library uses Vectors instead of Arrays which combined with source code optimizations resulted in 50% performance increase.

Requirements:

- Flex 3.5 SDK or later (to use with Flex 4.6 SDK or later use version 1.2, 1.3 or SVN version)
- Flex Builder or Flex SDK setup to target compilation for Flash Player 10 or later.
Latest version is always in SVN repository. More info how to get it from there in Source tab.
